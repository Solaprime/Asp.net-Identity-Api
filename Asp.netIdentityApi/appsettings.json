// Features is called a section  while HomePage is a subsection under Features 
// just playing with steeve gordon Configuration Course.


// we can create a weatherForecasting feature that will be use to enable or disable
// HomePageFeatures everywhere in our App, this is applicable if we wish
//to enable the homepage features everywhere in our APP. and we want a central switch
// to disable everythiong as well


// App settings json comes in two part, appsettings.json amd appsettingsdevelopemnt.josn
// properties specifed in the delopment.json overides wat is specify
//in the appsettings.josn based on environment
// you can add  appsettings file like a class so far it follows the convention
  // eg appsettings.Staging.json, appsettings.QualityAssurance.json


// initialyy we hard coded some of the details in the authsettings but 
//now we will access them directily form app settings
